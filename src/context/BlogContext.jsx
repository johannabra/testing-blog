            text: "Feeding sharks is both thrilling and risky. While it may seem adventurous, its crucial to consider the dangers involved. Sharks are apex predators finely tuned by evolution, and introducing food can disrupt natural behaviors and lead to dependency. Moreover, feeding sharks can alter migration patterns and increase human-shark conflicts. There's also the significant risk of close interaction, with potential injuries or mistaken identity bites. Conservation efforts often discourage feeding sharks to protect both humans and these magnificent creatures",
